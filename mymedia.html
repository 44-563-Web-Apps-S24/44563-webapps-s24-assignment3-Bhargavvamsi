    <h2>Interesting Fact about My Favorite Book</h2>
    <p>"Gulliver's Travels" was anonymously published in 1726, with Jonathan Swift later confirmed as the author. The anonymity heightened the impact of Swift's satire, leaving readers to speculate on the true identity of the author.</p>

    <p>
        "RRR" is my all-time favorite movie. Directed by SS.Rajamouli, it's a mind-bending masterpiece that explores the concept of dreams within dreams. The intricate plot, stunning visuals, and a stellar cast led by Jr.NTR & Ram Charan create a cinematic experience that keeps me captivated every time I watch it.
